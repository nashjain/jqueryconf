During the workshop there will be time for you to use the tools on web sites of your choosing, so come prepared with a computer and a list of sites that you would like to inspect. They don't need to be your own sites, you can tear apart a popular web site if you would like.</p>

Variables, Functions, Inheritance, Modularity and a whole lot more are all solved problems. Let's change how we think about approaching creating our styles and utilize the power of the most ubiquitous language already within our projects. You'll learn just how easy and powerful it it is to write JavaScript to generates CSS. This will change your world!</p>

                            <p><div>Facebook's React pioneered the idea of the Virtual DOM - a clever trick which resulted in a framework that supports a declarative programming style, allows pleasant modularity, and surprising efficiency. This talk will explore the ability to represent a web application as the Virtual DOM on the server side. The <a href="https://github.com/shashi/Escher.jl" target="_blank">Escher.jl</a> Julia package is attempt to implement these ideas. Escher introduces two twists in the usual Virtual DOM story:</div> <div> </div> <div>1. <strong>Extend the Virtual DOM idea to <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/" target="_blank">HTML5 Custom Elements</a></strong>. In Escher, things like event listeners, entities that send messages over web sockets are custom elements. You can attach these to other elements to make them behave in interesting ways. Escher also comes out-of-the box with a rich library of pure functions that result in DOM nodes. These DOM nodes address various needs: Markdown, Vector Graphics (via <a href="http://composejl.org/" target="_blank">Compose</a>), Plots (via <a href="http://gadflyjl.org/" target="_blank">Gadfly</a>), LaTeX, Layouts, Typography, Styles, Input Widgets, Clickable and Keyboard behaviors, even pages, tabs, menus, slideshows are all supported out-of-the box. This is done using Escher's custom elements (mostly the bits that support FRP) and the Polymer library (everything else, pretty much).  This library is entirely functional, and deals only with immutable values.</div> <div> </div> <div><strong>2. Represent DOM on the server side</strong>: The <a href="https://github.com/shashi/Patchwork.jl" target="_blank">Patchwork.jl</a> package provides the ability to represent DOM on the server. It is essentially a mirror of a VDom node in <a href="https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom" target="_blank">virtual-dom</a> - a pure JavaScript Virtual DOM library by Matt Esch. Escher sends the browser a JSON formatted Virtual DOM, and subsequently, sequences of patches sent as the UI needs to change.</div> <div> </div> <div>Escher works seamlessly with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/Reactive.jl" target="_blank">Reactive.jl</a> - an FRP library derived from the <a href="http://elm-lang.org/" target="_blank">Elm language</a>'s Signal library written for Julia. The result is a <span class="il">strangely</span> beautiful <em><strong>pure Julia</strong></em> web programming experience which lets you do beautiful and bold visualizations of data, write interactive / explorable explanations, and teach better.</div></p>

Practitioners claim that it has helped them significantly improve their development speed, design quality and responsiveness to changing requirements. Software professionals across the board, from Internet startups to medical device companies to space research organizations, today have embraced these practices. But can these practices be applied to front-end development? Especially jQuery plugin development?</p> <p>This demo will show how we can test drive a jQuery plugin with the help of various patterns, strategies, tools and techniques. Participants will understand how they can apply this approach for testing any jQuery code.</p>

                            <p>Functional Reactive Programming is a slightly different take towards asynchronous programming which helps creating simple and powerful software with good architecture. FRP reduces the complexity of a asynchronous code by providing a unifying concept to cover most things asynchronous, and the result is a easy to build and easy to maintain architecture. Reactive programming is a powerful concept, Meteor is a living proof of that. FRP is another, more advanced (imho) flavour of reactive programming.</p> <p>This session we'll create a moderately complex app called YARR (Yet Another RSS Reader) which is a decentralised social network of blogs, using jQuery and RxJS without any front-end isomorphic javascript framework. We're going framework-less for this session so we could concentrate only on FRP concepts which might be little hard to grasp for those who do little Functional Programming (sadly, most of Js devs). This session will demonstrate how FRP leads to a saner architecture for apps without relying on a framework for forcing your hand to do so. </p>

While jQuery allows us the abstraction powerful abstraction around cross-browser API differences, it can also prove to be a "security nightmare" due to the ways of usage.This session will take you through common jQuery security mistakes including XSS, data validations, inline events, URL encoding, hosted plugins and how to avoid them. The session will cover tools like like JSHint,JSLint and purifiers on the client and server side to secure webapps and avoid common pitfalls.</p>

                        <p>Over the past seven years, jQuery UI has identified and solved many common problems for web developers. Often times, the problems don't apply just to users of jQuery UI, or even jQuery Core. In these cases, we try to solve the problem in the best way for the largest audience, rather than creating an isolated solution within jQuery UI. We're able to do this by working with the community and bringing together various groups to collaborate on solutions. In this talk, I'll discuss how this concept is at the heart of the jQuery Foundation and explain some of the projects that have been born out of jQuery UI.</p>

                        <p>You can find solutions to thousands of jQuery problems on the Internet in blog posts, StackOverflow answers, or on Github. The problem is, many of those answers and code snippets are very obsolete! The web development world of 2006 that jQuery was born into is very different than the world of 2015, and jQuery has evolved to keep up. Yet there are still features inside of jQuery that only remain because of compatibility concerns, not because they're a good idea in modern web development.</p> <p>This talk will discuss features of jQuery that are best to avoid if you want a fast web site or HTML app that works with the widest range of browsers--even browsers that haven't yet been released! You'll also learn how using some of these features can make it very hard to follow modern practices such as Responsive Design. For each feature, you'll learn the modern 2015 way to do each of these tasks.</p>

Data-Driven Documents (D3) is a&nbsp;modern day tool which helps in creating interactive visualizations of complex data and does so easily by binding data with elements in a document.</p> <p>&nbsp;During this presentation, we will understand&nbsp;the meaning and importance of relevant data-visualization, types of data-visualization and the factors that come into play when choosing a particular type of visualization.

        <h1><img src="img/sponsors/joomla.png" width="300" style="width: 300px; vertical-align: middle"> HACKATHON</h1>

        <p>This hackathon is a platform to showcase your project or find other hackers/collaborators to work with you on your pet project. It is also a great opportunity to start contributing to an open source project like the Joomla project.</p>

        <p>We've room for 50 people to participate in this hackathon. If we get more than 50 people, we might shortlist them based on their project/idea. </p>

        <p>Participants can apply under anyone of the following categories:</p>

        <div>
            <div class="prize">
                <h3>1. Democratizing Education</h3>
                <p>Internet is the most powerful learning tool out there. We've seen the rise of Massive Open Online Courses, which are disrupting the tradition, pre-career education system. Having said that, we are still a long way from democratizing eduction .i.e. easy, affordable, inclusive access to authentic educational content. Few key challenges are: easy access to high-speed Internet, discoverability of authentic content (noise to signal ratio is very high), shortfalls in literacy skills in developing countries, disability barriers (accessibility related challenges) and so on. Can you design a solution that can address one or more of these challenges?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="prize">
                <h3>2. Being Good Citizens</h3>
                <p>For most open source projects, India is the bigger user base. Yet our net contribution to these open source communities is negligible. Typically the main challenge is in getting started, once developers experience the joy of contributing to open source projects, there is no looking back. Can you design a solution that can encourage more developers to contribute to open source projects? </p>
                <p>As part of this theme, we've representatives from the Joomla project at the conference, who will help the participants to contribute to the Joomla project. They will host a <a href="http://www.hackathon.io/joomla-bug" target="_blank">bug-squash</a>, where you can find new bugs, fix already reported bugs and/or verify that a bug is indeed fixed. This is a great way to kick-start your open source contribution.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="prize">
                <h3>3. Just For Fun</h3>
                <p>Working on interesting pet project (IoT, Robotics, Big Data, Neuromorphics, Nanotech etc.) for fun and for learning/exploring new technologies? Interested in showcasing what you've done so far? Find other interesting hackers or even collaborators to help you with your project? This theme is dedicated for hackers working on kewl pet projects. Submit your project idea to participate in this event.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="clear: both"></div>
        </div>

        <p>Participants can start working on their idea right away. However during the conference they have 24 hrs to put finishing touches to their idea. We've a few mentors available during the 24 hrs to help you. </p>
        <h3>Demo</h3>
        <p>On the last day of the conference, we've a 60 mins demo slot, where all the demo-able projects will get 5 mins to showcase what they've built. </p>
        <h3>Winners</h3>
        <p>Based on public votes from attendees in the room, we'll select the winners.</p>

        <div class="parts">
            <a name="review-process"></a>
            <h3>Call for Proposals</h3>
            <p>To present at jQuery Conf 2015, please submit your proposal before June 15th via our <a href="http://confengine.com/jquery-conf-2015" target="_blank">public proposal submission system</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="parts">
            <h3>REVIEW PROCESS</h3>
            <p>Interested speakers are requested to submit their proposals directly on our <a href="http://confengine.com/jquery-conf-2015" target="_blank">proposal submission system</a>.
                All proposals will be public. Registered user of the submission system will be able to comment on your proposal. You are required to reply to those comments to provide clarifications, explain revisions and respond to questions. The program team will look at how well you've responded to comments and updated your proposal to incorporate public suggestions. Ultimately the decision to accept a session resides with the program team.</p>
            <p>Your proposal stands the best chance to be selected, if it's unique, fully flushed, ready-to-go. Please ensure you've read:</p>
            <ol class="list">
                <li><a href="#selection-criteria" target="_blank">Selection Criteria</a> </li>
                <li><a href="http://2015.agileindia.org/#speaker/good-proposal-attributes" target="_blank">Good Proposal Attributes</a> </li>

            </ol>

            <p>To encourage early submissions and iterative improvement of proposals, we'll start accepting proposals as soon as we find them a good fit. As time passes by, the competition gets tougher. So don't wait till the last date to submit your proposal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="parts">
            <a name="selection-criteria"></a>
            <h3>We Value</h3>
            <p>In terms of the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">overarching themes or values</span></em> in the proposals, we look at the following criteria during selection:</p>

            <ol class="list">
                <li><b>Diversity</b>  - As a conference, we want to be more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inclusive</span> (different approaches, different programming languages, gender, countries, back-ground etc.)</li>
                <li><b>Balance</b> - We want to strike a good balance between <span style="text-decoration: underline;">different types of presentations</span> (expert talks, experience reports, tutorials, workshops, etc.) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">different types of experience</span> the speakers bring to the conference.</li>
                <li><b>Equality</b> - We encourage <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more students and women speakers</span>. We won't select any proposal just because it came from a student or a women speaker. But given we have to pick 1 out of 2 equal proposal, we'll pick the one, which was proposed by a student or a women speaker.</li>
                <li><b>Practicality</b> - People come to a conference to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">learn, network, have an experience and leave motivated</span>. Proposals which directly help this are always preferred. While a little bit of theory is good, but if the proposal lacks practical application, it does not really help the participants. Also people learn more by doing rather than listening. If proposals has an element of "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">learn by doing</span>" it wins over other proposals. Take people on a learning journey.</li>
                <li><b>Opportunity</b> - While we want to ensure the conference has at least 70% rock solid speakers, we also want to give an opportunity to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">new speakers</span>, who have real potential</li>
                <li><b>Originality</b> - Original ideas wins hands-on from copied one. People always prefer listing to an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">idea from its creator</span> rather than second or third person. However, you might have taken an idea and tweaked it in your context. You would have gained an insight by doing so. And certainly all of us want to hear your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">first-hand experience</span>, even though you were not the creator of the original idea. We are looking for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thought-Leadership</span>.</li>
                <li><b>Radical Ideas</b> - We really respect people, who want to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">push the boundaries and challenge the status quo</span>. We have a soft-corner for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unconventional ideas</span> and will try our best to support them and bring awareness to their work.</li>
                <li><b>Demand</b> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Votes</span> on a proposal and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">buzz on social media</span> gives us an idea of how many people are really interested in the topic. (We fully understand votes can be gamed, but we've a system that can eliminate some bogus votes and use different types of patterns to give us a decent sense of the real demand.)</li>
